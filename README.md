## My Process

As per request by a friend of mine I made this text overlay tool. As for the functionality added, it was not that complicated. It basically includes a whole lot of toggling. There were two small bottlenecks: 
  1. Had to find out how to return to default state after choosing another image. Was super simple after all, but somehow I didn't see at first.
  2. It was my first time working with input type='file'. Had to learn everything on the spot, but again, quite easy to figure out.
